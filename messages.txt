What the heck? How can I know I find something if I can't see it?
Yikes!!! Thats a skull! Oh wait, it's just a rock.
I'm surprised the ceiling on this room is still intact. If I jump it might come down on my head by the looks of it!
Why is everything covered in slime? I feel like a slug.
*OW!* I think I just walked into a rock!
Words, Words, I hate Words. Cavemen had the right idea with their pictures!
I hope I don't die in here I would hate to die, alone in the dark and the cold.
OH NO! I'm Trapped! It's cobwebs... Wait I can cut them with this rock. Stupid Arachnida.
I swear I hear footsteps... or is it just dripping water?
