What the heck? How can I know I find something if I can't see it?
Yikes!!! Thats a skull! Oh wait, it's just a rock. No words here though.
I'm surprised the ceiling on this room is still intact. If I jump it might come down on my head by the looks of it!
Yuk! A mouldy sandwich. It smells of the cheese my granny has in her socks. But there's no words. How hard can they be to find?
This room is bigger than the others *Clang!* *OW!* And as my head just discovered, there are chains hanging from the ceiling!
Words, Words, I hate Words. Cavemen had the right idea with their pictures!
I hope I don't die in here I would hate to die, alone in the dark and the cold.
OH NO! I'm Trapped! It's cobwebs... Wait I can cut them with this rock. Stupid Arachnida.
I wonder where I can buy a postcard? Dear Mom, I'm starving to death in a mouldy dungeon, hope you had a nice weekend, see you soon.
