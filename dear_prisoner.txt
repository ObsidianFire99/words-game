Dear Prisoner,

You know why you are here. You wrote somthing that someone didn't like.
You know the power of words. That is why you are in the labyrinth of words.
You will not escape until you have found the words in these chambers in order.
They construct a sentence. You will know when you have found the right word.
You will not know what it is until the sentence is complete.

Enjoy your Death.
